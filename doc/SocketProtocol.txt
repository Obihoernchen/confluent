The socket protocol is intended for high performance at the expense of a
non-standardized approach.  The thinking is that with http so well supported,
the socket protocol is empowered to do whatever is needed.

All data across the wire is TLV values.

A shorter single byte TLV variant was considered for lower overhead for things
like single character, but in every case where throughput efficiency would
matter is probably padded to 16 byte boundaries anyway due to block ciphers.

(all data has a 4 byte TLV for now)
Four byte TLs: (msb: 0b0)
Type=TL & 0b01111111000000000000000000000000 >> 24:
Length= TL & 0b111111111111111111111111
0: text string
1: json data

(msb: 0b1 is reserved), probably never to be needed
