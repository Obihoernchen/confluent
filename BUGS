-Reordering a group does not reorder inheritance preferences
-Setting multiple values at once where one is an expression including the othe
    can fail because the expression is attempted to set before
    the next setting comes to work and then we get a stack trace
    Should leave value out of it and set 'broken' with a reason as the
    value to the key
-cannot set expression value through confetty
-expressionkeys never gets smaller - perf impact
-need event notification for config change- e.g. set attribute triggers consol
 session object check to see if credentials changed
-When the time comes to dole out configuration/discovery, take page from xCAT
    'flexdiscover' command, if possible bring an ipmi device under management
    by way of ipv6 to eliminate requirement for ip to be specified.
    Requires the polling event support (which is required for security anyway)
