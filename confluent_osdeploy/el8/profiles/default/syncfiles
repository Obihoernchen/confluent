# This file lists files to synchronize or merge to the deployed systems from the deployment server
# To specify taking /some/path/hosts on the deploymennt server and duplicating it to /etc/hosts:
# /some/path/hosts -> /etc/hosts

# If wanting to simply use the same path for source and destinaiton, the -> may be skipped:
# /etc/hosts

# Entries under MERGE will attempt to be intelligently merged. This supports /etc/group and /etc/passwd
# Any supporting entries in /etc/shadow or /etc/gshadow are added automatically, with password disabled
# It also will not inject 'system' ids (under 1,000 usually) as those tend to be local and rpm managed.
MERGE:
# /etc/passwd
# /etc/group
