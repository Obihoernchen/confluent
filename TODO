-other auth
    -pam if user exists but has no passphrase
    -keystone?
    -ad? (specialized to the AD case)
-expressionkeys never gets smaller - perf impact
-When a user account is changed, have httpapi and sockapi notified of changes
 to kill off related sessions.  password changes are given a pass, but user
 deletion will result in immediate session termination
-When the time comes to dole out configuration/discovery, take page from xCAT
    'flexdiscover' command, if possible bring an ipmi device under management
    by way of ipv6 to eliminate requirement for ip to be specified.
    Requires the polling event support (which is required for security anyway)
