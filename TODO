-Reordering a group does not reorder inheritance preferences
-Setting multiple values at once where one is an expression including the othe
    can fail because the expression is attempted to set before
    the next setting comes to work and then we get a stack trace
    Should leave value out of it and set 'broken' with a reason as the
    value to the key
-expressionkeys never gets smaller - perf impact
-need event notification for config change- e.g. set attribute triggers consol
 session object check to see if credentials changed
 design is that calling code on init registers a callback for related node to
 the in-context config manager object.  callback shall be OO so no context
 object parametr passed in.  ipmi will use it for user/password/hardwaremanagement.manager
 changes to console and command objects.  console will use it to hook add/deletion
 of nodes and/or indicating a different console.method or hardwaremanagement.method
-When the time comes to dole out configuration/discovery, take page from xCAT
    'flexdiscover' command, if possible bring an ipmi device under management
    by way of ipv6 to eliminate requirement for ip to be specified.
    Requires the polling event support (which is required for security anyway)

-this stack trace (happened with method was set to ""):
